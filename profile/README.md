## Welcome to the home of [waypoint.guru](https://waypoint.guru)

**WaypointGuru** lets you easily plan trips, starting from scratch in a rich editing environment, or by pasting a *Google Maps* route link, that can be imported into apps
(such as *Garmin BaseCamp*) and GPS devices.

**WaypointGuru** lets you define primary waypoints (destinations where you plan to stop along the route) and shaping points (that simple control the route you will take).
You can set the planned starting time for your trip, and how long you plan to stop at each stopping point.
